## Introduction {.smaller}

Bayesian Logistic regression

-   Healthcare data include DNA sequences, functional images of the
    brain, patient-reported outcomes, and electronic health records with
    patients’ sequences of health measurements, diagnoses, and
    treatments. are complex, and the standard approaches are not
    adequate for clinical datasets. Use of Electronic Health Records
    (EHRs) with improved the diagnostic accuracy and predicts treatment
    effects. Visualizations of posterior distributions to help
    clinicians and patients to make their decision.Bayesian hierarchical
    model is a likelihood-based approach and uses priors providing
    sensitivities.@Zeger2020

-   Conventional methods based on clinical criteria and fixed numerical
    thresholds limit the information captured on the intricate
    relationship between diagnostic tests and the varying prevalence of
    diseases. The probability distributions associated with quantitative
    diagnostic test outcomes have some overlap between the diseased and
    nondiseased groups. The dichotomous method fails to capture the
    complexity and heterogeneity of disease presentations across diverse
    populations. The applicability of the normal distribution
    (conventional method) is critiqued in dealing with skewness,
    bimodality, or multimodality.@Chatzimichail2023Nonparametric
    Bayesian models were reported a better fit for data distributions
    given the limited existing literature, and were robust in capturing
    complex data patterns, producing multimodal probability patterns for
    disease, unlike the bimodal, double-sigmoidal curves seen with
    parametric models.

-   Bayesian statistics is used across different fields (social
    sciences, ecology, genetics, medicine) where observed and unobserved
    parameters exist. The stages of Bayesian analysis specify the
    importance of the priors, data modeling, inferences, model checking
    and refinement, selecting a proper sampling technique from a
    posterior distribution, variational inferences, variable selection,
    and its application across various research
    fields. @VandeSchoot2021.

-   The frequent combination of multiple testing has relatively low
    statistical power, which is problematic in null-hypothesis
    significance testing. Linear regression analyses do not account for
    the published results and summary statistics from similar previous
    studies. Ignoring information on parameters from previous studies
    (relevant and readily available), affects the stability and
    precision of the parameter estimates resulting in lower values than
    they could have been, resulting in conclusions that are less certain
    and are affected by sampling variation.

    Multiple linear regression with separate significance tests for all
    regression coefficients, and with the modest sample sizes, different
    studies have different sets of statistically significant predictors,
    and addressing the issue on larger samples is practically
    unrealisticDevelop a storyline that captures attention and maintains
    interest. @DeLeeuw2012a

-   The application of Logistic Regression included priors on
    coefficients and sequential updating to predict Individual-level CVD
    risk.Early diagnosis of at risk population (CVD), impacts health
    interventions. Limited availability of molecular information in
    clinical practice (high cost and unavailability) affects efficient
    disease diagnosis. @Liu2013

-   Bayesian approach for parameter estimation in discrete Weibull
    regression conditioned on the predictors under a uniform
    non-informative prior, to produce posterior distribution. The model
    promises its wide applicability to analyze count data using R
    package BDWreg.@Austin2021

-   The retrospective study used NHANES 2-year cross-sectional data
    (between 2013-2014 year) extracted from 3 datasets (demographics,
    exam, questionnaire). Response Variable (Binary, Diabetes) was
    defined as - "Is there one Dr you see for diabetes"

-   Predictor Variables (Body Mass Index, factor, 4 levels)

    The original data has BMDBMIC (measured BMI) as categorical and had
    no missing values. It (BMI_cat) has the following 4 levels:\
    o Underweight (\<5th percentile)\
    o Normal (5th–\<85th)\
    o Overweight (85th–\<95th) o Obese (≥95th percentile)\
    o Missing We kept it as it is as categorization provides clinically
    interpretable groups

-   Covariates:

<!-- -->

-   Gender (factor, 2 levels): Male: Female

-   Ethnicity (factor, 5 levels): Mexican American, Non-Hispanic, White
    Non-Hispanic, Black Other Hispanic, Other Race - Including
    Multi-Racial

-   Age (num, continuous)

Provide an overview of your approach.

To explore missigness in the data, we conducted linear regression lm (),
and listwise deletion of rows resulted in a reduced sample size (n=14),
which could introduce bias as the informative missingness if ignored
(MAR or MNAR). The regression resulted in quasi-separation (warning).

-   **Challenges of raw data**

    -   We found quasi-complete separation in the raw data (9799
        observations dropped)
    -   Reduced sample size with less number of complete cases (n=14).
    -   The model is overfitted to this subset and cannot be
        generalized.
    -   Huge coefficients (e.g., 94, –50, 73) and the tiny residual
        deviance suggest perfect separation and sparse data in some
        categories with very few observations, resulted in imbalance in
        the outcome (very few cases of 0 or 1).
    -   Logistic regression cannot estimate stable coefficients when
        predictors perfectly classify the outcome.

-   **Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE)** @JSSv045i03

    -   MI on raw data resulted in filling imputed values with resulting
        9813 observations with no NAs. A comparative bar plot on
        missingness in the raw data and the imputed data is presented
        below.

    -   A heatmap of the imputed dataset generated a correlation between
        **BMI categories** and **Diabetes status.** BMI dummy variables
        are strongly **negatively correlated.**

    -   **There was** no strong linear association between BMI category
        and diabetes in the dataset. Chi-square calculation of
        categorical varaibels revealed p-value = 0.5461, which is \>
        0.05 with no evidence of association.

    -   For the given raw dataset, Bayesian logistic Regression (GLM) is
        considered to calculate the probability of having Diabetes by
        incorporated default prior and using Bernoulli likelihood with a
        logit link is the standard, interpretable model for risk b.
